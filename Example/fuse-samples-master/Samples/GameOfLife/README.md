# Conway's Game of Life

This project uses an array of JavaScript Observables to produce a grid in the interface. It's a simulation of the classic game of life. 

The UI interacts with the JavaScript in several different ways. The grid is a two-way interface: it is updated by the JavaScript, and cells can be toggled on/off by a user click. The speed slider controls the stepping time used by `setInterval`. The `Switch` allows turning on/off the auto-stepping, with a button for manual stepping.
