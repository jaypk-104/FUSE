# Using the RelativeTo and RelativeNode properties

This sample shows the use of the `RelativeTo` property using the following values:

- Size: Moves the set amount times the size of the element. So Y="-1" moves the element by its entire height in the negative Y direction.
- ParentSize: Same as Size but uses the elements parents size instead.
- PositionChange: Used in response to a LayoutAnimation to move the element by the amount of change in position within it's parent.
- Keyboard: Moves the element relative to the size of the eyboard.

- Also the use of the `RelativeNode`
