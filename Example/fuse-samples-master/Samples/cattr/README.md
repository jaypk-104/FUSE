## Basic info
This is a basic mock app created as an example showing how to use Fuse's Router/Navigator features, and one way you might structure an app as reusable components. It's not meant to be a perfect example case, nor is it meant to be a starting template to start building your own app; it should, however, be helpful as an example that shows how the pieces might fit together.

## Fuse version
This example was produced with Fuse 0.20.3.
